                        My name is Robin Story Potawsky and I was born and reared in Lenoir, NC. Each of us has a story. Whether we decide to tell that story or not is a personal decision. Yet, I believe it is important for us as individuals, as a community, and as a society,
                        to remember our stories and preserve them for future generations. Let me help you honor and celebrate your unique story.

                        Memory is a tricky thing. Little by little, the details of our lives begin to fade. Take the take to reflect on the moments that have helped shape who you are. Mold these life experiences into a legacy story for future generations.

                    <p>Photographs tell a story; yet, do not forget to add your voice. Describe your feelings at seeing your baby’s “firsts.” Record your thoughts as you celebrate a milestone birthday or anniversary. Honor an active-duty or retired veteran.
                        Help someone you care for who is in a nursing home, hospital or under hospice care preserve their words. </p>

                            <p>
                                Schedule a planning meeting to discuss how you would like to catch your unique story. Your project might result in a published legacy storybook or a special digital story with pictures and music with you as the narrator.

                                The interview sessions will be recorded and last approximately one to two hours. I will listen to the story being told and ask questions. For digital stories, we will work together in creating a script.

                                After our interviews, I will transcribe the recorded sessions into a verbatim record. For a digital story project, we will produce a storyboard of the visual elements to be included.

                            <p> I will edit your story and do my best to keep the story true to the way you told it. We will discuss the areas that need more clarity. For digital stories, we will edit the project together.</p>

                            <p>I will present you with your final story and you will read and make changes until you are satisfied with it. For a digital story, we will work together on producing your video in its final form.</p>

                                If you decide to publish your story, there are many options available. The final digital story product is a video recording with you as the narrator. The initial planning session is free of charge. If you decide to move forward with a story project, we
                                can definitely produce a project to suit any budget.
